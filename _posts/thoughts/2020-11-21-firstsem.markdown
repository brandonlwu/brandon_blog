This semester at Yale has been absolutely amazing and the best three months I could have ever asked for. Despite the given pandemic, I feel like I have taken every opportunity to explore, make friends, and take risks.

**Here are some moments I loved**
* Playing frisbee in the courtyard during the first week, trying to connect silhouettes to names
* Hiking to East Rock and biking to West Rock
* Stargazing from the secret courtyard while answering [36 questions](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/09/style/no-37-big-wedding-or-small.html)
* Visiting the Yale Art Museum, going out for Ramen, and stargazing from a random rooftop
* Late nights exploring campus and trying to sneak into the buildings on Science Hill
* Charging into the freezing ocean in our undies at 3 AM
* A sleepless last night spent talking, dancing, watching It, giving hugs

**What I learned**
* Academia and research are probably not for me
* Finding a balance between working hard and playing hard makes life so much easier
* Being spontaneous and taking a leap of faith spices up life
* It's important to think about the future but I have to be flexible and open-minded with the big picture


**Some things I want to keep on doing**
* Keeping in touch with friends during break and our semester apart
* Zoom nights with 2E playing games, watching movies, and bonding
* Making friends and finding new organizations to explore
* Working on this blog!!


**What I want to work on in the future**
* Connecting and reaching out to Dean Rosas and Prof. T more
* Finding clubs/organizations which I'm passionate about
* Using university resources more and creating stronger connections with professors
* Keeping in touch with acquaintances and friends home


**More amazing memories**
* Movie and tea nights with 2E (our hallway)
* Traversing a corn maze and picking apples + pumpkins
* The awe of exploring campus for the first time after quarantine
* Playing ping pong
* Spending time with Jonathan listening to him play piano
* Painting pumpkins and "Trick or treating"
* Playing spikeball for 3 hours straight in the Murray tournament
