Off the top of my head, these are some possible options this summer.

1. **Self Improvement**. This summer would be a good time to explore and self-improve. I would work on projects, explore new topics, and also improve my organization. Some possibilities:
* Machine Learning
* CompNeuro
* Server and Network Design
* Stocks and Market Research
* Reading
* Exercise
* Handwriting
2. **Internship**. It is a bit late, but exploring industry would be a new and useful experience. It would be virtual, so the experience would be quite different.
3. **Research**. Working in a lab would be enriching and productive. I have spent my past three summers interning in various labs, so I'm hoping to explore some other options. However, given the circumstances, this may not be very viable.
4. **Wild Card**. Something unconventional (for me at least). Now's probably not the time though, but I'll keep this in mind for the future.
* Apple Picker
* **Farm Hand**
* Court Runner
* **Summer Camp Counselor**
